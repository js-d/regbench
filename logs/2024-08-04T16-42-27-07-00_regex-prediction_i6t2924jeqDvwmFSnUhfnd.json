However, they also need to be surrounded by whitespace or at the beginning/end of the string.\n\n### Match Evaluation:\n1. For `#simple`, it is preceded by a space and followed by another space.\n2. For `#logline`, it is preceded by a space and is followed by a space, therefore both are valid according to the regex.\n\nGiven that the regex matches whole groups that contain hashtags surrounded by the right conditions, let's see which matches first.\n\nThe first one, `#simple`, gets processed first along with the spaces, as it is the first occurrence of a hashtag.\n\nIn this case, `#simple` would be part of the match including precursory space, and thus the complete matching part is:\n```\n' #simple ' \n```\n\n### Final Result:\nTherefore, the expected match is `' #simple '`, so we return:\n\nMatch: ' #simple '"
